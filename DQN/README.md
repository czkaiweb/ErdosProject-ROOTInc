The folder contains code to train DQN models that interact with a budget constrained bidding environment . The plots are for +50, -10, 0 and +20,-10,0 for the cases when the customer clicks on the ad and buys, clicks but doesn't buy and doesn't click at all.

The main code for training is in dqntrain.py and baseline.py checks baselines.
